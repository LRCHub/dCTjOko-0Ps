Fuckin' on a thot thot
Chopper make 'em hopscotch
She cussin' 'bout a thot thot
She hotter than a Hot Pocket
These niggas faker than sci-fi
If he die, his mama cry cry
Yeah, your shirt, it got tie-died
We gon' spray 'bout that

Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, I'm surfin' this wave
Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, her pussy the wave
Wave, wave, wave, we the fuckin' wave

YSL and slime (Wave)
Slatt 'bout that crime (Wave)
And I'm ridin' on 'em,
I got Southside hitters (Southside on the track, yeah)
Hood babies, we the fuckin' realest (Hood babies)
Keep a tool, sippin' juice, pour a deuce
Neck pool, diamonds cool, fist water, waterproof
I'm gettin' mines, what about you?
I'm shootin' mines, worry about you
Chasing money, banging red
Alore bitches, busy head
Dior kickin', coppin' it
I ball, Pistons, keep a check
Dirty dirty, my drink dirty dirty
Maison Margiela splurgin', gangbangin'
I'ma let her fuck as long as she on a Perc-30
Got that blick on me and fire, no need for call up urgent
Doctor know he got hit with hollows, he didn't complete the surgery
We the wave, you can't save
My car is fast and foreign made
Rock these Yes in the rain
Put 'em in one room, they still throw shade
Push you by yourself, what it take?
Go by yourself and surf your wave

Wave, wave (Tsunami wave), wave, wave
Wave, wave, I'm surfin' this wave
Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, her pussy the wave
Wave, wave, wave, we the fuckin' wave
Wave, wave, wave, we the fuckin' wave

We get money, ooh, Hood baby, Mr. Screw
We go hard if you ten to two
We tote sticks like changing screws
Hollow tips, they break in two
Can't sink these ships, too wavy, fool
Hood baby, they hate me
We squat these bitches, slay 'em
The chopper toxic waste 'em
We chop these bitches down
No favors, we dangerous
We dawgs like the pound
I got time to shoot
Ready to slide, I'm dyin' for crew
We slidin', we timin' you
We caught you blind, you're tying your shoe
Cash out on deals, I'm signed to who?
I came with a spill, they mop, I'm the truth
Live at the top, we slidin' in coupes
Hotboxing rentals, it's time to shoot (Skrrt)
Hood baby drippin', we tote sticks and tape extensions
Young nigga wake up your neighbors
AR fifth with lasers, that's wavy

Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, I'm surfin' this wave
Wave, wave, wave, wave
Wave, wave, her pussy the wave
Wave, wave, wave, we the fuckin' wave
Wave, wave, wave, we the fuckin' wave
