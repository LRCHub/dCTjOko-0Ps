Don't stop at the wardrobe cue
Say the magic word and you can put it in the DJ Booth.
All Hands in the air
Focus on it one more time, you believe by chance.
We move on to a quiet room
Favorite colors on the left, let the auto tune, tune, tune.
Wait a minute, who told you so?
Well, somebody met somebody met and somebody met somebody I don't.
I do miss the days when I was younger
And everything about this place was new.
Now I still more often feel alone where
I used to be sure to meet my crew.
I have to chase my dreams in exile,
They went onto their new battle ground.
Closer every year to sound unsure again
But there's something that keeps me coming around.
